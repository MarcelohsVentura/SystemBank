# Working in progress
Thats a refactored code of a small bank system project that I made for practice.
Was made with Spring Boot and postgreeSQL, so if want to run the code, need to change some configurations on pom and resources, like password and username for connect on SQL, java jdk version (was made in jdk 17), lombok....
Actually three controllers are running (Account, Bank and Client), the nexts updates gonna be all the rest of controllers that the project need and after that, a small system to be more interative.
